Condemn'd `(condemned)` by Fate to way-ward Curse,

Of Friends unkind, and empty Purse;

Plagues worse than fill'd `(filled)` Pandora's Box,

I took my leave of Albion's Rocks:

> With heavy Heart, concerned that I
>
> Was forc'd `(forced)` my Native Soil to fly,
>
> And the Old World must bid good-buy

But Heav'n `(heaven)` ordain'd `(ordained)` it should be so,

And to repine is vain we know:

Freighted with Fools from Plymouth sound

To Mary-Land our Ship was bound,

Where we arrived in dreadful Pain,

Shock'd `(shocked)` by the Terrours of the Main;

For full three Months, our wavering Boat,

Did thro' `(through)` the surley Ocean float,

And furious Storms and threat'ning `(threatening)` Blasts,

Both tore our Sails and sprung our Masts;

Wearied, yet pleas'd `(pleased)` we did escape

Such Ills, we anchor'd `(anchored)` at the Cape;
```text
Cape: the "Capes of Virginea[sic.]," the first Land on
      the Coast of "Virginia" and "Mary-Land".
```

But weighing soon, we plough'd `(ploughed)` the Bay,

To Cove it in Piscato-way,
```text
To Cove:     To lie at Anchor safe in Harbour.
Piscato-way: The Bay of Piscato-way, the usual place
             where our Ships come to an Anchor in Mary-Land.
```

Intending there to open Store,

I put myself and Goods a-shoar:

> Where soon repair'd `(repaired)` a numerous Crew,
>
> In Shirts and Drawers of Scotch-cloth Blue
> ```text
> Scotch-cloth Blue: The Planters generally wear Blue Linnen.

> With neither Stockings, Hat nor Shooe.

These Sot-weed Planters Crowd the Shoar,

In hue as tawny as a Moor:

Figures so strange, no God design'd `(designed)`,

To be a part of Humane kind:

But wanton Nature, void of Rest,

Moulded the brittle Clay in Jest.

At last a Fancy very odd

Took me, this was the Land of Nod;

Planted at first, when Vagrant Cain,

His Brother had unjustly slain;

Then Conscious of the Crime he'd done

From Vengeance dire, he hither run,

And in a hut supinely dwelt,

The first in Furs and Sot-weed dealt.

And ever since his Time, the Place,

Has harbour'd `(harbored)` a detested Race;

Who when they cou'd `(could)` not live at Home,

For refuge to these Worlds did roam;

In hopes by Flight they might prevent,

The Devil and his fell intent;

Obtain from Tripple-Tree reprieve,

And Heav'n `(heaven)` and Hell alike deceive;

> But e're `(ever)` their Manners I display,
>
> I think it fit I open lay
>
> My Entertainment by the way:

That Strangers well may be aware on,

What homely Diet they must fare on.

To touch that Shoar where no good Sense is found,

But Conversation's lost, and Manners drown'd `(drowned)`.

> I cros't `(crossed)` unto the other side,
>
> A River whose impetuous Tide,
>
> The Savage Borders does divide;

In such a shining odd invention,

I scarce can give its due Dimention.

The Indians call this watry Waggon

Canoo, a Vessel none can brag on;
```text
Canoo: A "Canoo" is an Indian Boat, cut out of the body
       of a Popular-Tree [sic., Poplar-Tree].
```

Cut from a Popular-Tree or Pine,

And fashion'd `(fashioned)` like a Trough for Swine:

In this most noble Fishing-Boat,

I boldly put myself afloat;

Standing erect, with Legs stretch'd `(stretched)` wide,

We paddled to the other side:

Where being Landed safe by hap,

As Sol fell into Thetis' Lap.

A ravenous Gang bent on the stroul,

Of Wolves for Prey, began to howl;
```text
Wolves: Wolves are very numerous in Mary-Land.
```

This put me in a pannick Fright,

Least I should be devoured quite;

But as I there a musing stood,

And quite benighted in a Wood,

A Female Voice pierc'd `(pierced)`, thro' `(through)` my Ears,

Crying, You Rogue drive home the Steirs.

> I listen'd `(listened)` to th' `(the)` attractive sound,
>
> And straight a Herd of Cattel found
>
> Drove by a Youth, and homeward bound;

Cheer'd `(cheered)` with the fight, I straight thought fit,

To ask where I a Bed might get.

The surley Peasant bid me stay,

And ask'd `(asked)` from whom I'de run away.
```text
I'de run away: 'Tis supposed by the Planters that all
               unknown Persons run away from some Master.
```

Surprized at such a saucy Word,

I instantly lugg'd `(lugged)` out my Sword;

> Swearing I was no Fugitive,
>
> But from Great-Britain did arrive,
>
> In hopes I better there might Thrive.

To which he mildly made reply,

I beg your Pardon, Sir, that I

Should talk to you Unmannerly;

But if you please to go with me,

To yonder House, you'll welcome be.

Encountring soon the smoaky Seat,

The Planter old did thus me greet:

"Whether you come from Goal or Colledge,

You're welcome to my certain Knowledge;

And if you please all Night to stay,

My Son shall put you in the way.

Which offer I most kindly took,

And for a Seat did round me look;

When presently amongst the rest,

He plac'd `(placed)` his unknown English Guest,

Who found them drinking for a whet,

A Cask of Syder on the Fret,
```text
Syder: Syder-pap is a sort of Food made of Syder and
       small Homine, like our Oatmeal.
```

Till Supper came upon the Table,

On which I fed whilst I was able.

So after hearty Entertainment,

Of Drink and Victuals without Payment;

For Planters Tables, you must know,

Are free for all that come and go.

While Pon and Milk, with Mush well stoar'd `(stored)`,
```text
Pon:  Pon is Bread made of Indian-Corn.
Mush: Mush is a sort of hasty-pudding made
      with water and Indian Flower.
```

In Wooden Dishes grac'd `(graced)` the Board;

With Homine and Syder-pap,
```text
Homine: A dish that is made of boiled Indian Wheat,
        eaten with Molossus, or Bacon-Fat.
```

(Which scarce a hungry dog wou'd `(would)` lap)

Well stuff'd `(stuffed)` with Fat from Bacon fry'd `(fried)`,

Or with Mollossus dulcify'd `(dulcified)`.

Then out our Landlord pulls a Pouch,

As greasy as the Leather Couch

On which he sat, and straight begun

To load with Weed his Indian Gun;

In length, scarce longer than one's Finger.

His Pipe smoak'd `(smoked)` out with aweful Grace,

With aspect grave and solemn pace;

The reverend Sire walks to a Chest,

Of all his Furniture the best,

Closely confined within a Room,

Which seldom felt the weight of Broom;

From thence he lugs a Cag of Rum,

And nodding to me, thus begun:

I find, says he, you don't much care

For this our Indian Country Fare;

> But let me tell you, Friend of mine,
>
> You may be glad of it in time,
>
> Tho' `(though)` now your Stomach is so fine;

And if within this Land you stay,

You'll find it true what I do say ......

Up to Annapolis I went,
```text
Annapolis: The chief of Mary-Land containing
           about twenty-four Houses.
```

A City Situate on a Plain,

Where scarce a House will keep out Rain;

The Buildings framed with Cyprus rare,

Resembles much our Southwark Fair:

But Stranger here will scarcely meet

With Market-place, Exchange, or Street;

And if the Truth I may report,

'Tis `(it is)` not so large as Tottenham Court.

> St Mary's once was in repute,
>
> Now here the Judges try the Suit
>
> And Lawyers twice a year dispute.
>
> As oft the Bench most gravely meet,
>
> Some to get Drunk, and some to eat
>
> A swinging share of Country Treat.

But as for Justice right or wrong,

Not one amongst the numerous throng,

Knows what they mean, or has the Heart,

To give his Verdict on a Stranger's part:

Now Court being call'd `(called)` by beat of Drum,

The Judges left their Punch and Rum,

When Pettifogger Docter draws,

His Paper forth, and opens Cause;

And least I shou'd `(should)` the better get,

Brib'd `(bribed)` Quack supprest his knavish Wit.

So Maid upon the Downy Field

Pretends a Force, and Fights to yield:

The Byast Court without delay,

Adjudg'd `(adjudged)` my Debt in Country Pay;

In Pipe staves, Corn or Flesh of Boar,
```text
Pipe staves: There is a Law in this Country, the Plaintiff
             may pay his Debt in Country pay, which
             consists in the produce of his Plantation.
```

Rare Cargo for the English Shoar;

Raging with Grief, full speed I ran

To joyn the Fleet at Kicketan;
```text
Kicketan: The home ward bound fleet meets here.
```

Embarqu'd `(embarked)` and waiting for a Wind

I left this dreadful Curse behind.

May Canniballs transported o'er `(over)` the Sea

Prey on these Slaves, as they have done on me;

May never Merchant's trading Sails explore

This Cruel, this inhospitable Shoar;

But left abandon'd `(abandoned)` by the World to starve,

May they sustain the Fate they well deserve;

May they turn Savage, or as Indians Wild,

From Trade, Converse and Happiness exil'd `(exiled)`;

Recreant to Heaven, may they adore the Sun,

And into Pagan Superstitions run

For Vengence ripe————————

May Wrath Divine then lay those Regions wast

Where no Man's Faithful, nor a Woman Chast.
```text
Faithful: The Author does not intend by this any
          of the English Gentlemen resident there.

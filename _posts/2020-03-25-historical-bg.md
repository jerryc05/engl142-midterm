# Author: *Ebenezer Cooke* (aka *E. Cook*)

- A London-born poet who wrote the "first American satire": "The Sotweed Factor, or A Voyage to Maryland, A Satyr" (1708) *(Wikipedia)*.

- He was fictionalized by *John Barth* (the author of "The Sot-Weed Factor") as the "comically innocent protagonist" of *The Sot-Weed Factor*, a novel in which "a series of fantastic misadventures leads Cooke to write his poem" *(Wikipedia)*.

- Although *Cook* did voyaged to Maryland as a young man like the persona of his poem, however, little is known about his real life. Cook's existance can only be traced through his poems *(Ebenezer Cook(e))*.

  - He was admitted to the bar of Prince George's County, Maryland *(Ibid.)*.

  - He practiced law on occasion before returning to London by 1694 *(Ibid.)*.

  - He later returned to Maryland after inheriting a half interest in his father's estate at Malden, Maryland *(Ibid.)*.

# Comments of The Sot-Weed Factor

- It became a revenge as he "hurls insults and curses" but some argued that the humor in the poem is two-fold. *(Ford 1)*.

  1. The factor "pointed out the shortcomings of the colonists *(Ibid.)*."

  2. He reveals himself to be "a buffoon unable to negotiate hfe in the New World *(Ibid.)*."

- As a result, both audiences for the poem, the English citizens and colonists, would find it humorous *(Ibid.)*.

  1. The English citizens would laugh at the portryal of colonists as uncivilized *(Ibid.)*.

  2. The colonists would laugh at the British factor's ineptitude *(Ibid.)*.
